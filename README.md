In the summer of 2019, I worked as a Network Engineering Assistant (NEA)
for what was essentialy UC Berkeley's IT department. Part of my job included
uploading CSV files from Google Sheets to a Linux server and then running
a network configuration script. The pipline for doing this felt inefficient to
me; this was my attempt at builing a quicker, more convienient pipeline.

This project remains unfinished, and likely won't ever be. I began working on 
this at the end of the summer during downtime on the job. I ended up returning
to school in the fall before making any significant progress on this.
